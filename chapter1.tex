\chapter{Introduction}

Here i should write about why i am researching this.

\section{Motivation}

\section{Research Goals}

\paragraph{1 - Set up a pipeline}
The first goal of this study will be to setup a software pipeline in the most beneficial way. The pipeline should extract examples from Wikipedia. The output of the pipeline should be a searchable database of the examples.

\paragraph{2 - Define a good example by using their structure and content}
To be able to create a high quality database consisting of examples, a deeper understanding is needed. Therefor the second research goal in this study will focus on the nature of the examples. The study will look into how the examples are structured, what properties are preferable in certain circumstances and what the content of an examples should be in regards to its domain. 

\paragraph{3 - Create and populate a database of examples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To be able to populate the database, we first have to create the database. The type of the database is essential, since it will directly affect the process of inserting and retrieving examples. The modeling of the database in terms of possible entities, relations and properties will also have to be considered.
    \item When the database is created the next step will be to populate it with examples. Based on the models decided for the database, queries will be created that inserts all relevant examples.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4 - Search examples //mer spesifikt og forklarende}
The fourth and final research goal is about making use of the database from the third research goal and present a interface between it and the users. There should be a page that lists all the results after a search and a page for individual examples. When looking at individual examples, links to related examples should also be shown. Two different types of queries will have to be defined, where one is based on a search phrase from the user, and the other is based on a selected example. Usability of this interface should be tested on user stories for evaluation.

\paragraph{4 - Search examples //mer generelt of kortfattet} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item To make use of the database, a set of queries will have to be defined. We have to decide what information we need to present for the user. Then we can define the queries needed to fetch this information from the database.
    \item An interface is needed to make the user able to execute the queries. The interface also has to present the result of the queries to the user.
\end{itemize}
