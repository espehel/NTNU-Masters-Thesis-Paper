\section{Research Goals}

\paragraph{1 - Setting up a pipeline to produce a searchable index}
The first goal of this study will be to learn how to setup a pipeline, described in section \ref{pipeline}, in the most beneficial way. The output of the pipeline will be an index of the examples. The index should be built in a way that makes the examples easy to search and find other related examples.

\paragraph{2 - Identify a good example by using characteristics, structure and content}
To be able to create a high quality index consisting of examples, a deeper understanding is needed. Therefor the second research goal in this study will focus on the nature of the examples. The study will look into how the examples are structured, what characteristics are preferable in certain circumstances and what the content of an examples should be. 

\paragraph{3 - Structure the index and queries, to allow users effectively search the index.}
The third research goal is mainly directed against the end result of the process. How the index is structured and built is important for which possibilities the queries will have access to, for interaction with the index. Having the option of choosing different queries will increase the usability of the index to the benefit of the end user. 

\paragraph{4 - Create a user friendly interface for displaying and browsing examples}
The fourth and final research goal is about using the results from the third research goal and present the examples to the user. There should be a page that lists all the results and page for individual examples. When looking at individual examples, related examples should also be shown.
