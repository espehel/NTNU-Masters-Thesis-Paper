\paragraph{1 - Set up a pipeline}
The first goal of this study will be to setup a pipeline, as described in section \ref{pipeline}, in the most beneficial way. The pipeline should extract examples from Wikipedia. The output of the pipeline should be a searchable database of the examples.

\paragraph{2 - Define a good example by using their structure and content}
To be able to create a high quality index consisting of examples, a deeper understanding is needed. Therefor the second research goal in this study will focus on the nature of the examples.

\paragraph{3 - Decide the index structure and describe queries that allows users to effectively search for examples.}
The third research goal is mainly directed against the end result of the process. How the index is structured and built is important for which possibilities the queries will have access to, for interaction with the index. Having the option of choosing different queries will increase the usability of the index to the benefit of the end user.
