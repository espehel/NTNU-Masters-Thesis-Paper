\section{Motivation}

\section{Research Goals}

\paragraph{1 - Set up a pipeline}
The first goal of this study will be to setup a pipeline, as described in section \ref{pipeline}, in the most beneficial way. The pipeline should extract examples from Wikipedia. The output of the pipeline should be a searchable database of the examples.

\paragraph{2 - Identify a good example by using their structure and content}
To be able to create a high quality index consisting of examples, a deeper understanding is needed. Therefor the second research goal in this study will focus on the nature of the examples. The study will look into how the examples are structured, what properties are preferable in certain circumstances and what the content of an examples should be in regards to its domain. 

\paragraph{3 - Structure the index and discribe queries that allows users to effectively search for examples.}
The third research goal is mainly directed against the end result of the process. How the index is structured and built is important for which possibilities the queries will have access to, for interaction with the index. Having the option of choosing different queries will increase the usability of the index to the benefit of the end user. 

\paragraph{4 - Create a interface for searching, displaying and browsing examples}
The fourth and final research goal is about using the results from the third research goal and present the examples to the user. There should be a page that lists all the results and page for individual examples. When looking at individual examples, links to related examples should also be shown. Usability of this interface should be tested on user stories for evaluation.
