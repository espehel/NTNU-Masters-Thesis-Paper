%Preface
%This master thesis is submitted to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU, with specialization in Data and Information Management, in Department of Computer and Information Science. The thesis is the last part for fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Master of Science.

%In the in-depth specialization project at NTNU in the previous semester, I and my then partner, Marte Nordrik Hallan, conducted a project on novelty detection based on a paper by Zhang et al. [30]. The relevant theoretical parts within novelty detection and information retrieval will be presented here, since the same methods are used within the scope of the master thesis. The thesis is conducted with relation to the doctoral thesis Geo-Temporal Mining and Searching of Events from Web-based Image Collection of Massimiliano Ruocco [25].
