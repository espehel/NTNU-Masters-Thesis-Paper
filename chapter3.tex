Wikipedia is a web page presenting articles for the user. This leads to high focus on the usability related to users searching and reading articles. Because of this one can say that their articles are stored as an atomic entity in their database. An articles has no internal structure, except for the markup used to present it. That means that a process is needed to identify and extract examples from Wikipedia articles. This 
project%%Hva burde jeg kalle dette?
