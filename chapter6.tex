\section{Future Work}
There are several aspects of this project which would benefit from an extended amount of work or research

Firstly the system itself, can be greatly improved by being able to accept examples from different sources. The foundation for doing so already exists in the system, since the idea of extracting examples from different sources have existed since the beginning. For simplicity and saving time, this project has focused on only using Wikipedia as source, and therefor is overly tailored for Wikipedia articles. But since the different processes in the pipeline is extremely independent, replacing them to accommodate other sources should be a trivial task. Accommodating more sources would result in a richer database of examples, which in turn would help the end user.

Another aspect that could benefit the system is a deeper knowledge of examples, and how they relate to each other. A better understanding could improve both the rating of their relevance score when searched for and displaying related examples. Improvement on finding related examples, can give a natural learning progress when browsing from one example and to its related ones.

The search itself could also be more optimized. Since Elasticsearch was chosen to manage the database of examples, the search API served by the Elasticsearch process could be explored further. Elasticsearch offers a great amount of different customizations that can be applied, which would make the search more complex, but also could improve the search results.
